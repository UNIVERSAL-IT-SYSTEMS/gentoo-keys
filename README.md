Gentoo Keys
-----------

### About 

 Gentoo Keys is a Python based project that aims to manage the GPG keys used
 for validation on users and Gentoo's infrastracutre servers. Gentoo Keys will be able
 to verify GPG keys used for Gentoo's release media, such as installation CD's,
 Live DVD's, packages and other GPG signed documents. It will also be used by
 Gentoo infrastructure to achieve GPG signed git commits in the forthcoming git
 migration of the main CVS tree.
